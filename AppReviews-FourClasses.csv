"Urrrrm	After my third re installing, it finally has scenery. Before hand, it was just black shapes everywhere. I could not even see the walls. This killed my internet as it is a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, their is no chance of a refund. Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to be seeing the right installment first time, a chance of a refund, and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I would love to have it on my tablet! Thank you ?",Bug

"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",Bug

Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

"Update, EN performance has improved considerably (from 2 to 3 stars) since my last review, however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch, it freezes momentarily between all actions, it crashes here and thee, and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium, but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note, some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues",Bug
"I love Evernote and have become very reliant on it, one of the apps I can't do without however I am without it now because it crashes on open and will not open on iPhone  DO NOT load the Dec 12 update!  Evernote please fix",Bug
The app has been unbelievably buggy since the last update Cannot trust using it on iPhone (only desktop and iPad),Bug
Brilliant app but crashes on iPad and iPhone,Bug
I dislike the latest version My notes randomly disappear They are listed under the wrong name (usually by the one that is actually above it) I LOVED the version prior to this one This version is making me lose my confidence that my notes are actually being saved!,Bug
"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber

The mobile app, however, seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements,' which are essentially ads, now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra-premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work, I'd subscribe!

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

ORIGINAL REVIEW
Thanks for your hard work Happy to be a premium subscriber

Only suggestion add ability to copy note links",Bug
"I really wanted a note system I could trust, but Evernote just lost all my notes on the upgrade",Bug
It seems Evernote did not understand the spirit of iOS 7 The design seems flat for the sake of flatness Usability has been thrown out the door It's very confusing to use the app Simple actions are painfully slow,Bug
"Okay Evernote, I hope you are listening You had a great idea But 'note' should not be in your name Call it Eversomething The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentation, etc Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting I don't know, but until this is fixed it is not useful And man I've really tried to like Evernote The synching ability among so many platforms was great But I have to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you will read this But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities Please fix this I really want  need a proper Evernote!",Bug
"The search function isn't working and I have to sign in every time I open it Evernote needs to fix this Other than that, I love Evernote",Bug
"Was just beginning to trust this app until 7 update Quit working for all practical purposes
Will watch for patches and post an updated review I really was wanting this app to be effective They have some silly new process to sell post it notes Not!",Bug
"?The highlighting of words works but the menu that pops up to copy, cut, paste etc Won't stay open long enough to be used
?When placing the cursor over text when the keyboard is open makes the text jump every where but where you want the cursor to be",Bug
No notes showing up All the notebooks are there but they are all empty Boo,Bug
"Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But, really! The notes, bullet points, spacing, numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message 

All that aside, I like calling up notes on my phone, ipad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version, it doesn't In fact, if this version were more solid, I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade",Bug
"When this app worked, I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 (after I tried reinstalling and rebooting) is to log in using user name instead of email (or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other) But annoying this happens at all 

If it works for you, this is a pretty good app to help you keep all those notes you scribble down and email yourself in 1 place",Bug
"Today's update, dated March 1, 2013 is horrible!  Every single time I open up the App, it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then, when I select either 'Title', which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes, in alphabetical order, or I select 'Created,', the App immediately crashes and closes  I have tried this over 50 times! I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail  I tried deleting the App all together, and then reloaded it, but still the same problem!  This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE!!!!!!!  I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created, and even each month is not in alphabetical order  THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE!!!!  I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents  If this bug isn't fixed pronto, I will have to delete Evernote permanently, and use a different App!  ARGHHHHHH!!!!!!",Bug
"I was looking for the longest time the save (Favorites feature) button until I noticed that it only appears when iPad is hold in vertical position (upright) This was so weird I usually hold my iPad for trip advisor in horizontal position (sideways), so the button was nowhere to be found? I hope that the tripadvisor fixes this UX usability issue soon",Bug
Was an excellent app  Now crashes on iPod touch since last update  Won't open at all Please fix asap!!,Bug
"Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf? Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house

Next problem, related to this is the 'Near Me' function First, the app couldn't find me Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version",Bug
"Most of the hotel reviews, especially from poor hotels, are fake and most likely posted by employees Notice how after a negative review is posted, it is invariably followed by several glowing reviews And because TripAdvisor is paid by the hotels listed on this site they will remove negative reviews if pressured by the hotel",Bug
I love this app It helps me a lot when I'm on the trip but one thing that makes me mad that when I click to see the photos It's only show 1 pic and I got stuck I have to delete the app and redownload it again ??????,Bug

App runs too slow!!!,Feature
"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",Feature
"I listen to it a lot. However, it will once in a while disconnect for no apparent reason. When it disconnects, it will repeat previous transmissions. I would like more APD and less Fire and Ambulance. Great app!",Feature

Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!,Feature

Probably a great app for 4 and up. I've used it with several 2 year olds and it's amazing how quickly they catch onto the spelling part. However they are confused by the plane when they can't move it. The tilting the iPad this is not natural for them and the fact that if you're not directly on the plane when you try to trace the letters really throws them off.. If only there was a way to play this on easy mode it would be perfect for younger kids to learn their ABCs. Then activate the tilt functions when they are older or master the easy parts.,Feature

Would love to be able to print right from the app instead of having to go through the browser or open it in another app Otherwise very convenient,Feature

4 out of 5 because still can't rename files",Feature

"Ok people...this app works and if you are too stupid to figure out how to make something so simple work, you shouldn't own a smart phone, especially the iPhone. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the addition of all the contacts. Looking forward to future updates. ????????",Feature

"N4 kitkat	Still getting dark images on pictures taken with flash despite update.",Feature
"I love this app. Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like, you can't see what the temp actually is. I would love to be able to see both at the same time.",Feature
"worst	it ws awesome app before d last update doesent show my pictures",Feature

This update would be a step up if you could actually see PDF's with it,Feature
The app would be great with two 'features'  One the ability to read long filenames  The app truncated all my files so I can't tell which is which in our companies file naming procedures  Really is a complete PITA  Next there needs to be a clear cache option  I download a 700 mb file and open it in a app I really don't need to have it in two places on my iPad  Add these missing features for more stars,Feature

"First of all, both Dragon Dictation and Dragon Search are amazing and I'm using the slow 3G. They're beyond amazing on my wife's iPhone 4! As a heavy user of Dragon Dictation, it would be very useful to be able to clear the screen and start new, perhaps by shaking the iPhone. Sometimes it's easier to start over rather than edit out one word.",Feature
"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",Feature
I just wish you could edit your word documents other than that it's great!,Feature
"The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.",Feature
"The inverted colors of the icon induce retinal after images, and in-app, the whiteout is hard on the eyes The experience on an iPad Air is one of huge expanses of white or badly contrasting off-whitelight blue and stencil-thin pale icons battling the brightness of it all The spartan look works fine on an iPhone, where there is proportionately less white assaulting the eye with the iPad, however, I keep trying to reduce the brightness of the display, but that only further impacts contrast and legibility 
Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders??",Feature
"Help	Won't let me download its saying I have no memory on my phone but I do I have loads :/",Feature

"update kept crashing	What was a barely usable programme to begin with, kept crashing after I updated. So I have now Uninstalled it.",Feature
"Not very impressive	I am a graduate student and I use my tablet a lot for taking notes during presentation and to read papers. I am disappointed as I can't use the software to present ppt. Also, the draw free form option is not very user friendly as it doesn't allow to draw in different colors nor to erase.",Feature
Would totally give 5 stars if u didn't have to use the app by itself & send from there! Would be nice to be able to choose app from inside text message or email! Can u work on that?,Feature
"Hhfg	Too slow to download",Feature
"Doesnt work	Teamspeaks preloaded channel works, but app crashes upon connecting to any other server. Too bad, could've been useful.",Feature

"It's very convenient to use, however not being able to switch between accounts without un-linking the phone would be great Also an improvement in the media player would also help",Feature
"Unusable	Unusable. Whem trying to find the right forum it takes forever to scroll down!",Feature
"Love it	Great app  Which there was a way to multi check pins When editing  (deleting or moving to another board) rather than having to do it one at a time",Feature
I love the app for allowing me to keep my notes organized and synchrd across devices I also love the feature of sharing stuff with mates The only thing I long for is collaboration on notes,Feature
"Update	The app refused to update but others would. Had to uninstall.",Feature
This has become my main notes program  Wish I could do handwriting on it  Love how can I can put outlook emails in it   Using more than my other note apps in the iPad,Feature
"Not happy	I downloaded this app because I have the first one and I loved it but this one will not even load on my phone all I get is a black screen and music plz fix",Feature
"Badd	The New Updated One Sucks . It Dosent Even Save THE picturess.",Feature
I like the new features that make the product more Stanza-like. I still would like to be able to go directly from the library list to the current place in any given book without having to pass by the TOC page.,Feature

"I sat down and worked out the equiv. IQ for each category based on the data given and Average professional college IQ used for this program 119.985 ~120.

It would be really nice to get an integrated IQ-Equiv feature that showed us this information like the excel calculator I made for myself.

Keep up the great work!",Feature
Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.,Feature
I love pasting notes to ever note I paste my passwords I paste copies of receipts and anything that I need to locate later and I can easily find it in one location the search option is very handy as well I WISH THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEARER,Feature
Still landscape only  So weird  Every other app has the ability to go either direction  Too bad,Feature
"So so	Why cant email be marked as unread? Why when I reply to an email it turns up in my inbox?",Feature
"The recent update makes this app look really beautiful (upgrade from the previous version!) but in the process we have lost functionality and it is not intuitive. I am a woman and the arrows are kinda small to navigate between areas; I could only imagine how most men--the likely demographic--feel about this app. Additionally, It takes too long to move between the screens. I want to easily/quickly set my line up, maybe see my opponent's, get quick updates on the health or status of my players for the week, and see the weekly fantasy scores as they update.",Feature
"Broken Multiplayer	Multiplayer doesn't work at all, I just get failed to connect every time. Would give 5 stars if online ever gets fixed.",Feature
"Useful, improved	Happy with the progress on this app but there are many updates that seem to make no change Can't see the names of many boards - there needs to be a wrapped text function on board names so long board names can be seen Indexing is very slow too, many of my pins take weeks to come up in search",Feature
"Why doesn't the music work	Upsetting to have a clip made but NO music... Tried it for my business and this Is actually very disappointing.",Feature
"This is probably the app I am the most thankful for on my iPhone -- perhaps second to Omnifocus. Thanks to this app and the care given it by its development team, my wife and I are finally budget -- not account. The account balance is servant to the budget and how we have planned to spend our income. 

If you are moving from something like Quicken, then there is a bit of a learning curve. The YNAB website is there with excellent video tutorials to help you work through questions and situations. Awesome resource. 

Looking forward to iCloud sync and the possibilities it presents. Again, great app.",Feature
Overall a great app.  I use it daily. It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included. I do not appreciate the new  in app purchase feature.  The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this.,Feature

"NEEDS FIXING	Everytime I get ready to use the picframe and go to pick a photo when I return to the frame it only shows the texture. I have to go through this same problem everytime I use it.

"All my apps are intrusive??	What happened? I have had my apps since then. But all of a sudden, antivitus is telling that 101 threats was found? (All apps)?? Howcome?! All my apps are downloaded from playstore. There should be threat even before if all my apps are really intrusive!",Feature

Was good until the cent updates Now my notes vanish randomly and I keep getting a sync error This app needs added features too,Feature
"Pretty good!	I've edited many photos using this application already. Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview. The beautify tool is a good example of this, as it may look fine in preview, but when you save it, you don't exactly get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated, but overall a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.",Feature
"Multiplayer cant join	Cant join games, just keeps searching. I tried custom join and says error can't join",Feature
"The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful, and makes accessing files on the go far more convenient I also think the latest style refresh is a big positive in the right direction I use dropbox on all of my devices I would like to see sorting within the app improved (eg by date), but it's good otherwise",Feature
"Thanks, Evernote, for a great app!  I use it DAILY to keep my (gluten-free, dairy-free) recipes organized!

A tip Please allow me to search ALL my notebooks - helpful to locate an ingredient - rather than searching within each notebook individually

Also, I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline  Thanks",Feature
"Can't get a response from Developers	The game itself isn't bad. If anything,  a bit monotonous.  However,  the manual is less than desirable,  specifically when speaking about how to feed cows. I figured out meadows on my own, but cant make straw bales for the life of me. And, this is apparently hkw to create manure flr fertilizer. I have emailed the developers, amd received no response. VERY FRUSTRATING! You spend money in the game for equipment that you can't use.",Feature

"Can I go back to older version?	Loved the app, was quick and always connected until the last update.  Have tried every suggestion.  When I first open it, nothing happens, it just sits at an empty screen.  Have to close and reopen several times and it is so slow to connect now.  Hope it improves.  To be fair, I am having same is with lastest tappatalk upgrade also.  Galaxy Note",Feature
"LG Spirit	many bugs sometimes it wont shoot a picture and i have to reopen app, orientation when I rotate phone works about 20% of the time, touch to focus is terrible, focus in general is terrible no matter what setting and other things as well.

"Doesn't start up	The app gets to the loading screen and then force closes, please fix. Running Android 4.4.2 kit kat on a nexus 7 2013. I'm assuming it force closes as I'm using ART runtime. Please update to work with ART! :-)",Feature

"Popularity from Herd Behavior	Millions of users can be wrong. This app and application has a poor interface,  allows all sorts of strangers to harass you,  is not intuitive.  The messaging only works sometimes, no indication of it has been read or not.  It is a bandwidth hog. Corporations hate it on their networks. Oh and I still have out installed. Part of the herd....  :(",Feature
"Loved it until...	The most recent update has left me less than pleased. Double posting pics, messing up the way cover photos look, it's NOT better in fact it's worse. I use to give it 4 stars now it barely gets 2. Please fix before I lose more fans.",Feature
"Functionality is as advertised, but still buggy	I use DSLR controller via wifi on a 6D. During operation varying function such as aperture control, white balance, etc would cease to react irreproducably. Timed bulb exposure (being the only advantage over Canon's own app and the reason why I bought the app) causes the app and the camera (!) to crash. Disappointing and expensive. I keep hoping for more reliable updates.",Feature
"Idk	Why does it FOREVER to download!?! I have a galaxy 3 mini and its so long :'( Like i downloaded it cuz its says download over wifi and i accepted it and it was still downloading for two !@#$ing hrs!!!!!",Feature

"Black screen	I get black screen after using flash. It seem to be random. Anyone else experienced the same problem?",Feature

"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",Feature
"good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must need is to make the timer continuous. After the 5 sec. countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots. Please add that.",Feature
I've had this app for about a year. I love it but can you bring back backups or dropbox so I can transfer files to my laptop. Please do this,Feature
It needs more of the things that powerpoint has. It needs to be able to have music durring the presentation and more animations.,Feature
"Love it, just wish it had the option do make brochures,",Feature
"Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants, but that is literally all you will find. No grocery stores, cafes, or anything that is not fast food or large chains. No coffee shops other than Starbucks and no foreign foods, and definitely nothing remotely healthy. Also lacking an option for submissions.I was excited at the possibilities for this app but the reality is much more disappointing.",Feature
"99cents can't go wrong. I'd like to have a map feature, but overall it does what it was programmed to do well.",Feature
"But wish it had better ability to copy WODs if you do it more than once.

Update: this app has come a long way and is really awesome now!! Love it!!",Feature
I've been using Marine Traffic for years online and on my iPhone. Downloaded the iPad app and it's as simple (good thing) as always and the content is great. I only give it 4 stars because it needs Retina support which would make it excellent.,Feature
"this app is great i dont have to get on my computer download the music then pass them itunes then transfer it to my ipod but i would love it if we had an option if moving the MUSIC to our music libary, when i have that option iLL give this a thumbs up five stars",Feature
It needs redstone and online world mupltiplayer accessibility Cus I'm already bored of the update!,Feature
"Clear has one of the best-designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone/iPad. It is the way apps should be. So simple and easy. I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:

1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.
2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)
3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's ""detail page"" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. 
4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is ""feature creep"" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",Feature
But i wish u could use it offline,Feature
"I use my Yelp app daily and frequently for everything.  Love it.  Only gave 4 stars because of the loss in functionality.  Why can't I publish reviews with app, why don't we earn open table points using app?",Feature
It would be even better if you could drive an airplane.,Feature
this is a pretty good app. great to be free. it is super slow on load time. that needs to be fixed. also change the default time. it's so annoying because sometimes I forget to change it and dont see all my hw. also push notofications would be wonderful! other than that it's great. I'm a sophomore math major taking 20 hours and this app helped me stay on top of things!,Feature
"It's need an update where u can post a new chapter of your story and where u can upload a cover for the story! >:0
And it keeps crashing!",Feature
NEEDS bulk upload and maybe some editing features. Photobucket's app is much better...what a shame. I would much rather use Shutterfly because of their awesome deals on print orders. But it takes way too long to upload from the iPhone. On the photobucket app as soon as you start the app it recognizes all the pics in your camera roll that haven't been previously uploaded and with one click it will upload all the new ones. Shutterfly needs this :-(,Feature
They should add the photo editting option.Then this app would be perfect.,Feature
It seems like it would be a great addition to have the hold mail feature from your website here also.  Please include this in the next release!,Feature
It's almost 2011. Where is the multitasking?,Feature
Requires access to grades and it'll get 5 strs in my book,Feature
"3 days won't do. I need at least 5 days. Seems user friendly and easy to follow. Perhaps if it added the ingredients--not multiple entries for the some onion, per se.",Feature
"Decent app. Finally, notifications are here. Now please give us multi account login, Google.",Feature
"I love the Brave version better than the original. The graphics are much better and I love the phrases she says.

The objective of hitting 100 is stupid when I don't know how I've done, if I have improved or not when a status on targets hit is not given. 

Tally it up in a drop down much like the distance markers at the end of each target segment.",Feature
Please make it more like the one on the computer like a option that you can download stuff,Feature
? Why can't I sign into separate Drop Box accounts?,Feature
"You should put the folders first And then the files!
I would put a folder as favorite, thus putting all the files inside this as favorite too",Feature
"Im on an original iPad mini and so maybe that's part of he deal but it seems like there are still little thins that need some work For example the spell check doesn't work just right and the search is slow at times Neither of these or any others will keep from giving this app a great rating 

I also think that here are improvements I hope to see in the future One is full screen mode Maybe I'm missing this but the only time you get full screen is when you start a new note I'd like this options when reading or editing too 

Keep up the good work!",Feature
"I have a premium account and I use Evernote for business and personal items all day long and I am very frustrated about the new advertisement section I've been graced with despite paying not to have advertisements  Also, there is no logic behind the new tag section I really like the the tag section, but I want to organize what pops up there I can't find a master list of reminders in the app or the desktop version Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but this seems to be a gaping oversight  A calandra would be nifty as well",Feature
Outstanding  Would be nice to have the PC app features available in IOS app,Feature
"The app present good features, but there is a lot of bugs and missing some hotkeys to make the writing easier",Feature
"This is really a great app an tool to manage multiple projects and scattered notes I just wish that there was a calendar integration and sub folders within stacks 

Also in Evernote hello there is no categorizing 

But make no mistake I swear by this program",Feature
"I would give this 5 stars if it had these two additional features

Ability to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone rather than swipe, swipe, swipe and more swipe to get to the bottom of a note 

Ability to keyword search AND GO TO THAT KEYWORD like you can on the laptop version Having search feature for a word does me no good if I can't search within the note to find that word

Can you do these two things for iOS please?",Feature
"This app has been very helpful on my honeymoon search It would be nice to be able to enlarge the photos though Other than that, it's perfect",Feature
Please add landscape support for your fat-fingered users!,Feature
"No Galaxy Gear support	Please create an app for Galaxy Gear I can only read the notifications on my Gear I would love to have an option to reply directly from my Gear Thanks",Feature
"Perfect	Vry gud app for editingplz add some more interesting frame-)",Feature
Love the service but annotations on PDFs have disappeared from Dropbox since iOS 7 update Need these back please,Feature
Still no ability to change file names - a very basic function Hard to believe after this amount of time Error messages when simply trying to move files No response from dropbox,Feature
I can't share folders!  That was the only reason I made a Dropbox in the first place  Ugh,Feature
"Even Google Drive can refresh folders 

Some simple suggestions to increase usability

1 Currently, you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality, true color representation, then#REFRESH!
2 Refresh Button
3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents
4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it?
5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button
6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker
7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button  Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely
8 Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell? Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet! Yaaay!",Feature
Some places that had menus on the old version are missing them on the new one Other than that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use  Much improved navigation,Feature
"The new update loads slower, closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos, this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months  ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts, I would like to stay at in another place (state,country)",Feature
"Can't get enough	Brilliant app Switched to a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 after an iPhone and noticed the option to switch off timestamps is unavailable on Samsung devices If this could be included in the next update, 5 star rating sorted",Feature
"Video playback sucks	This is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser, then to youtube Please allow for in-app playback to bypass all the nonsense",Feature

"Seriously needed permissions?? I think not!!	Why in the world would I give anyone or application the right to make phone calls through my phone, edit my text messages and send them, take video and pictures?? This is sadly getting worse with each update and this is supposed to be a security program??? I was pleased at first with this app but have no respect for it or the idiots coming up with these updates. This needs to stop!!! Next you will need to access my credit report.

"Costs too much and too many add ons	Despite its many options, I've had experienced many issues with this product. It has crashed quite a few times already in the last two days, moreover why do I have to pay so much for 'add ons' that should be standard such as fonts and dictionary? This just shows the developer is being too greedy.  In addition it seems to be very slow on my nexus 10",Rating
"Abysmal controls and AI, repetitive campaign	Fun game, abysmal controls and AI.  Why on earth team 17 opted for touch controls instead of virtual arrows or a d-pad, I have no idea. Now the AI: uses grenades or bazooka about 90 percent of the time with absolute perfection. Calculating wind speeds and never missing a single shot even if it is necessary to shoot in the complete opposite direction and rely solely on wind. Please make it more human and make it use the other weapons a lot more often. Plus the campaign is just skirmish,  no actual missions.",Rating
"Nice	I like it",Rating
"Awkward menus	I bought this app. ..quickly attempted to do my most common types of formatting, and found it very slowly and fiddly on my note 2.  Much better on the BlackBerry.  So, as quickly as I could, I attempt to un install and get a refund, can't!!! So am I stuck?",Rating
"AVG	Tried and tried and tried to use the AVG find my phone part of this app. . Didn't find it once just kept saying try later.. so I did and kept on trying.. I paid for this app so I kind of expect it to work?? Not enough to the app either. . Dull to use.. looks Dull and had I not paid for it I would delete in a heart beat..",Rating

"Not horrible...but	All in all, it's in the tradition of the franchise. In campaign mode it's pretty annoying that the AI never misses, and the wind is always exactly what it needs to hit.",Rating
"Ehhh	Every level after 19 is ridiculously hard.  The enemy worms take hardly any damage and seem to aim perfectly through the tiniest spaces while your worms die by 1st or 2nd turn,  leaving you with 1 worm against 8 or 9... I'm ready to uninstall",Rating
"Specs fail	I noticed the same on my note 2 it says tht i have dual-core...",Rating
"Grt	Gud",Rating
"Android	Very nice app",Rating
"Same old worms, terrible controls.	The developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system, it does not support controller or keyboard input. The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient. This game is so tedious to play, it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it. If you bought this during the sale; you got a great deal, but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17, I'm disappointed in this lackluster port. Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly. I am however, happy to give Team 17 a few extra dollars, and hope they make improvements over time.",Rating
"Money ripping	I have played this game on pc and realised it was released for android platform. As soon as i downloaded it (and payed for it), it is ridiculous that they are still charging so much money for other mini games available in the game. Really disappointed with this. Please resolve this issue n i'll give this game a 5 star.",Rating

"The best -- one suggestion	I'd love to see an option for TRUE black and white saves -- not just an option for high-contrast greyscale. That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic. 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit.   I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit (though they can be read by most PDF viewers), but given storage size concerns, I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option.   Great job on all the rest though.",Rating

"Excellent, just what I wanted	Works great on my Galaxy S3.   I have 5 different sync folder pairs set up. One is for my pictures so that when I take a picture, it will instantly be sync'ed to my google cloud account, and then my PC syncs with google cloud, meaning I should never lose a picture.   I also do an occasional sync to my NAS drive as I'm a bit paranoid.  I also sync from my MP3 folder on my NAS account back onto my phone card, so that when I add some new music to my NAS drive, it will sync onto my phone.  Altogether a very useful program.",Rating
Great security. Let's me know about any threats on my phone.,Rating
"Great app love it	Can't get any better",Rating
"EA Keep up the good job!	The game's superb..",Rating

"Great app,  easy to use!	This app has completely surpassed my expectations! It is extremely easy to use, has a nice interface and let's you produce a wide variety of collages.",Rating
"This game is really fun and a great way to learn facts, geography, capitals, landmarks and locations of all of the great states in the United States! My nephews are into strategically placing the stacks. Super learning fun!",Rating
I love how it tests my brain!,Rating
"You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free...I thought the same thing and finally ponied up (do you really spend *that* much more/less on a cup of coffee?) and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable. Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab. Has saved me so much in time.",Rating
Easy to find songs and purchase in iTunes.,Rating
"Having fun. I never had much interest in astronomy, but this app has changed everything.",Rating
Lots of fun to use... We live in a unpopulated area and it's neat to pick out which stars are what. The app works very well!,Rating
"It's really useful cuz I'm a astronomer          

It's magestical!:/",Rating
A very exciting app. I like to share with my kids.,Rating
Very nice app,Rating
Great info on Houston restaurants though some restaurant info needs to be updated such as those which have relocated.,Rating
"The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities, it's pretty much useless. Even if you do live in a big city, the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller, which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup.",Rating
"I bought this app on December 24th. I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set. I had issued where the terrain map would not load, and was blacked out. All other maps and features worked fine. I emailed customer support that night around 11pm., and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am, Christmas morning! Now, that's what I would consider excellent support. Seems there was a small issue  with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd, and Saturday the 24th. I am all fixed up now and everything works great!",Rating
"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth. 

I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time. 

I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app.",Rating
"I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are. If you mountain bike, hike, camp, or travel this is a must need app! It now tracks altitude, pace, speed, and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure. By far this is the best app I have!",Rating
"Pretty easy to use - been using it for over 2 years.  Easy to learn.  As new features were added, those features made sense!",Rating
"This is, hands down, the most useful app. I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade. It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar. I love it!!",Rating
Ran side by side with other and this app beat all hands down. Needs dedicated space for mileage.,Rating
Love it's multifunctionality. Able to do multiple business and year prior expenses etc!,Rating
"This ap is great, really puts your collection at your fingertips! I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection, buying, drinking or storage notes. Love it!",Rating
Works awesome for me. Have 1200 cellar of mostly older bottles. Scan works a lot but type and search fills in. Really live off this app. love the drink now feature. Use that every week!,Rating
Better than any other wine app.,Rating
It is a good app but I eat a lot of home cooked meals and it's hard to find the exact thing I ate.,Rating
"This app is beast! The best thing is, is that it doesn't need Internet! Because I have an iPod touch so I don't have Internet on it in public. I recomend  this app!",Rating
Buy it,Rating
This is a great little app especially for those with hectic schedules it keeps you in like for visual people like me.,Rating
"Live sky does not work on my touch. Also, doesn't find my correct locAtion. So close to being like the Droid app...but off by a parsec.",Rating
"I keep tabs on my brother's flight info,  as he travels for work quite a bit. I'm a worrier by nature, so it's wonderful to be able to see the progress of his flights. I've always been able to pull them up easily & they've always been accurate. Great job!",Rating
Used this app all over the world and it hasn't let me down yet!,Rating
I take this on the mountain and on the bike trail. Continually improving in surprising ways. Keep up the great work!,Rating
It's a pure joy already having a pic when your friends call and sometimes contacts info from your FB friends that you haven't taken the time out to acquire. Fabulous!,Rating
I love the sync & bday reminders :),Rating
Works just fine.,Rating
Great app!,Rating
"Now that it comes with iPad Keynote integration, this app is worthwhile to get.  My only complaint is that notifications on the iPad interrupt it.  Which you can fix Apple by improving the notification system.  *cough*.  So get this if you use Keynote :)",Rating
"To those concerned that you cannot zoom in on those savvy charts and reference materials included on this app...you CAN! Let me help. Simply tap on the chart or image itself. This will then immediately bring it up closer in its own page, and then you can get even closer by pinching. Just tap the images first, my friends. This is a great app.",Rating
At first I didn't have the challenges on and literally got board in about 10min. But when I turn the challenges on I was all over it like a hawk of a dead animal. So to get to the point BETER THAN MODERN COMBAT 3!!!!!!,Rating
BEST GAME EVER!!!!,Rating
I can't find how to buy add ons. Plz help other wise great game,Rating
I will give it 5 stars when you add girl pygmies.,Rating
Great app to have for tracking flights! I own a limousine company & all my drivers use it to track their clients flights.,Rating
Easy to use and very accurate. A must for any traveler!,Rating
I just finished up a weekend of playing and it was the first time I have used this product. I was more than impressed with it! The setlist option was my favorite part. We played several different times throughout the weekend and being able to program the songs into setlist form made it super easy to transition between songs. I highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it again!,Rating
A must buy.,Rating
"For the price, it's great. I've been using quicken for 5 years now, but I've switched to this app 2 years ago. My wife and I use the sync option and are now keeping a budge very easily. Awesome app- needs a desktop version!",Rating
"This app is a fixture in my college studies. Good Reader technology turbo charges my research and puts me ahead of the pack. I couple it with Instapaper, papers, and an air printer app or two and the power is in my hands (and pocket).",Rating
I use this app every day on my iPhone 4 and it works perfectly fine.,Rating
I enjoy sending verses to my friends on my iPhone,Rating
"I love having a new verse pop up every morning. Great for on the go, and if you're looking for a verse pertaining to a certain category whether it be encouragement, patience, etc. Very convenient. And beautiful background pictures.",Rating
"I love the convenience I having daily readings right at my fingertips, and when I travel to Europe for the semester, I don't know if I could live without it!",Rating
Great for daily readings. I love it.,Rating
This is an excellent app to use in the daily devotional reading of the mass readings.  Well done!,Rating
Overall a great app.  I use it daily. It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included. I do not appreciate the new  in app purchase feature.  The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this.,Rating
What a bargain for all the benefits I receive daily from this app!!  The audio is especially good to have.  Reading (or listening) to the daily Mass readings has been a great help to me.  I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day.  I consider this to be a must-have app for all busy Catholics.,Rating
Doodle jump is sick. I love it! He's so freaking cute!,Rating
"I needed a good flash card system for my Mandarin vocabulary, and this is everything I could have asked for.  If never heard of Quizlet before, but by enabling the extended keyboard for pinyin, and my Simplified Chinese keyboard, I was easily able to make a custom list of words.  ? (shu?) on one side, and ""water"" on the other for instance.  Inputting them to this app was super easy!  Very well done and totally worth the $4.  Quizlet is free, by the way.",Rating
"Pixel for pixel, this scanner does better than an expensive HP printer/scanner. Part of that is the iPhone but the other part is JotNot's software. I use this in my presentations for text off a page. (it doesn't do so well with images though, hence the 4 stars.) taken as a whole, it's money well spent.",Rating
Fantastic app ! Makes reading forums so much easier that now I find myself doing it more. Great!!,Rating
I like a lot,Rating
"I think this app works better than using my desktop to use forums. Fast, eat to read, searches well. Wish it had Miniusa and Bike forums... Great for Tacoma World.",Rating
"If you use forums a lot, you'll love this app!",Rating
Excellent,Rating
Good,Rating
The best App ever!!,Rating
You'll love Craigslist pro,Rating
I have only purchased a few aps but this for sure is one of them.,Rating
Awsome,Rating
There are different categories missing since the update. What's wrong with this?,Rating
Sweet app. Thank you! I love it!!,Rating
Awesome!!!,Rating
Need more for finding rental HOUSES. But great other than that!,Rating
"This app is far better than the usual web interface - intuitive, fast, and great graphics.",Rating
I have sold and bought many things using Craigslist.,Rating
"This app is just like the website, except you have to pick an area instead of having them laid out for you. I love this app and use it every day!",Rating
Easy to find what you want and narrow the search.  The photo gallery feature is great when your first filter is how it looks.,Rating
Great,Rating
Freaking great!,Rating
A+,Rating
I have used this for over a year and have never been disappointed. The sound quality is excellent on the iPhone.,Rating
I will give this app a much higher rating if you fix the Larimer County Fire and EMS...,Rating
This app rocks!!!!!,Rating
"Good app.  Gets me to the info I want quickly, and auto adjusts times to my time zone (many apps don't)",Rating
I love this app nothing better for the NASCAR fan!,Rating
I love dis right Herre,Rating
"I have been using this product for 5 days and I love it.  If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper, do basic spreadsheet, and reading PDF articles, this is the one.  Of course, you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality (called great marketing).  But if you are a poor student like me, paying student loans, and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs, I recommend with this one. I have not tried the PowerPoint yet, so I can't say much about it.",Rating
I love it,Rating
"Got this app to be able to share PPT and Word docs. Does not support all of the data from those files. Not happy with it at all. Will try to work with it, but I think it was a waste of time and money!",Rating
Great!,Rating
great app!,Rating
Highly recommend this app to listen to ATC conversations from around the USA and world,Rating
VERY WELL,Rating
Great app. Works on almost any course. No complaints at all.,Rating
"Overall fantastic.

The UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesn't look like a button.

Wish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round.

Statistics could use some work as well. The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed. 

Needs a better social aspect.",Rating
"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",Rating
"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. 

Anyway, must have for all serious golfers.",Rating
This app while not perfect (some songs it doesn't) is very good. I use it severalvtimes a week.,Rating
I use this every night... It amazes me how little sleep I get most nights. I have made sleeping more of a priority since using it. I can see the difference!,Rating
Just what I wanted to know!,Rating
Provides for hours of uproarious entertainment!,Rating
Great app to keep track of hours. Especially if you're on salary or budgeting.,Rating
Great!!!,Rating
Thank you for this great resource and thanks to all the readers. Driver,Rating
This a great tool for a rapid lab consultation.,Rating
"Some stories are just down right terrifying. I have had experiences myself. So I can relate. It's a must buy for your iPad, iPhone, iPod!! No joke!",Rating
"I am a very superstitious person. I love any kind of ghost story. Short, Long, or a book. But this app has everything from short stories to long. Definitely worth the $$",Rating
I love This app honestly I don't care if there are mistakes in some stories it's normal. This is app is great! Download now! It's worth 99 cents.,Rating
Awesome,Rating
Ive sent in a story and i know thi app is BEAST!!!,Rating
I'm ten and this stuff does not scare my and I'm  10 YEARS OLD!!!!,Rating
Recently used in several European cities and it was GREAT!,Rating
"Well I have used Magellan it was cool and then I bought a navigon that was the biggest waste of 350 dollars of my life then I used sprint navigation that was fairly accurate so there I have had a couple and this is one of my favorite navigation devices the huge difference is the price 99 cents can't be beaten.     

Update to a month and a half later.
I love this navigation devise have used it more than my factory one I can listen to my music while navigating and it's points of interests rock ! The turn by turn speech and real time traffic is long gone but I don't miss it at all ! If I could give this app more stars I would",Rating
"good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must need is to make the timer continuous. After the 5 sec. countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots. Please add that.",Rating
"The best news, I always check Drudge first for the rest of the story!",Rating
Smooth simple app,Rating
"It's just getting better and better. The signature capture is a huge time saver. Ever wonder how to put your contact info from their email into your Contacts, just copy their signature into this app, it will separate into different fields and put them in your iPhone Contacts. How great!",Rating
can't live without my scanners.,Rating
Someecards are super funny! They're a great way to give someone a good laugh. Sometimes I just like to look through them because they're fun to read.,Rating
"Still need to check each, I think I need to improve technique.  Cards with multiple addresses throw it for a loop.  Very easy to export to excel",Rating
That says it all.,Rating
Love this app! Easy way to keep track of what's in my closet and mix and match pieces. Even better when I got an iPhone so I could take pictures of my clothes and load directly to the app. Perfect for any Fashionista!,Rating
"Excellent product. Continue development of similar programs for other subject areas.   For instance science, history, Christianity.  Pray for God guidance, America. God bless. BP",Rating
Great App for Travelers. Highly recommend it!,Rating
Fast and convenient app to search for flights,Rating
Great app. even for smaller regional airports.,Rating
"I use powerOne all the time, whether for a simple conversion, or working out mortgage payments for a new dream house. Highly recommended!",Rating
"A well engineered multipurpose calculator.  If the extensive template library doesn't have what you need you can easily create your own calculators without a steep learning curve. As a repeat customer since the Palm handheld days, I definitely consider this a great value.  Keep up the good work!",Rating
I find that this app does exactly what I wanted it to do- display meaningful data from all the iPhone sensors. Very clear and intuitive interface. It's really the only tool of it's type I need.,Rating
Very nice-looking app!,Rating
"My only complaint with this otherwise wonderful app is the absence of any warning for the bottomless ""hole-in-time"" this thing hides. If you are not very careful, you will fall into this hole (which isn't marked in any fashion by a navigation tool that marks everything else) and your family or friends may lose you. Leave a note and tell them where you went, and don't worry, you'll meet thousands of new friends down in that hole! Finally, I wrote/chatted with the guy who wrote this - good man and thanks for this jewel!",Rating
Best app in the entire world,Rating
This app has helped me control my phones battery usage.,Rating
It's easy to use. Keeps the battery conditioned for sure.,Rating
"Does what you need...
Monitor the cops
Learn the lingo",Rating
"Great app, but I  agree, needs more coverage.",Rating
"I love it, I wish there were more feeds",Rating
Nothing like listening in on big brother!,Rating
This is so cool. I love how many different frequencies there are to listen to.,Rating
Good Job!!!!,Rating
"This app works wonders. ""Scans"" come out very clear and easy to send items. One of my most used apps!",Rating
"I use this app for completing my required expense report. Stores pics so you can return to them, pics are super clear. I'd only wish for a two per page option as the scans come back a full page. Overall, only $2. Hell of an app.",Rating
This is a great app ...,Rating
Good,Rating
Love it but it's crashing with the new update!!,Rating
my ??wouldnt b the same without it! ??,Rating
Best replacement app if your laptop is broken!!,Rating
Nuff said ; thanks for the update!!!! Works well for datpiff.com,Rating
If u know how to use the app then it's perfect in every way it does what it's supposed to! Worth every penny,Rating
Really does what it says -- provides an amazing view of the heavens above your head.,Rating
Worth every penny I spent.,Rating
"No words, just I love it, definetely 3$ very good invested!!!",Rating
"This is a great educational app for students, especially the movies! It provides a great visual for abstract content.",Rating
I finally found my old 3D glasses and took a look at this app again  WOW. A thing of beauty. Mesmerizing!,Rating
Love it!,Rating
I've purchased 4 different swing apps. This one is by far the best! Great buy!,Rating
One of the best ones!,Rating
Since signing up I've lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks it's great,Rating
Best!!!,Rating
Really like this app. It has been soo very helpful in tracking with everything instantly accessible. It really is amazing. Having previously worked in the weight loss industry for many years. I know that this is the key to planning and losing weight. I am doing well with both.,Rating
Simple to use. Works flawlessly.  Loads of books to choose from.  I'm a fan.,Rating
Really enjoyed this reading. Much better in the car than the junk on the radio.,Rating
"Nice presentation   Of course, the books come from Librivox and the quality varies according to the talents of the volunteers.  I have found that most of them read well.",Rating
"The interface works great and mapping is nice :) 

Only bug I've seen is Facebook integration at times.",Rating
"I've bee using EveryTrail.com for years - loving its ease and look for uploading my rides and embedding the maps on my blog. I used the free app for a long time, until recently on a trip I needed to find a trail and download it to use offline. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS unit. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs. Worth every penny.",Rating
Just got it...  I'm sure it will be used often..,Rating
Helps so much with meal planning and grocery shopping.  Cuts time off of both those activities.,Rating
A must have if you like to cook.  I think it is great!  Have tried a baked chicken wing recipe and was almost like deep fried.  I'm from Buffalo NY so I know.  Like being able to save Recipes in recipe box on the app. Get this app.,Rating
"Can't figure out how to modify, add, delete the main recipe folders and titles in the recipe box. Please explain.",Rating
This app is amazing! It has helped me so many times!,Rating
Great in every way !,Rating
I love the pro version - well worth the money. I use it way more than the other cooking apps I have purchased.,Rating
So much fun,Rating
It is such a helpful app! People of all abilities will love it to help improve and learn!!!,Rating
"I listen to it a lot. However, it will once in a while disconnect for no apparent reason. When it disconnects, it will repeat previous transmissions. I would like more APD and less Fire and Ambulance. Great app!",Rating
"love the app ?? but one more problem, please cut down the prices on iWork to 3.99 dollars and the iLife apps to 1.99",Rating
"Great game, this game is great to pass time",Rating
Helpful notations. Wish the illustrations were a bit more defined.,Rating

"Good basic muscle app, worth the $",Rating
"I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is given in audio; I wish there was an option hearing all the muscles info in audio. For me, retaining info comes better in audio, activities, and constant quizzing.",Rating
I was very pleased with this app.  The graphics are excellent and the interface is very easy to use and navigate through.  The quiz options and video are a great bonus feature.  I am really satisfied (especially for the price) and look forward to trying out the other systems' software.  Nice Work!,Rating
"Excellent app, integrates well with Google Reader. A must-have app on all of my iDevices.",Rating
Love app easy to use,Rating
This product does what it says.,Rating
Very helpful in planning trip.,Rating
I love this app because it gives you lots of great ideas for your home.,Rating
update done for August and not working.  Why,Rating
A real lifesaver and eye opener for this iPad newbie.  I learned so much from this app.  Information is well written and easy to understand. Just wish my brain could retain it all for instant recall!,Rating
Nice!,Rating
"Did not give 5 stars because have found not all campgrounds are listed.  Sure is helpful though 99.5% of time.  Have used for gas, reservations for camps, restaurant locations, low clearances.  Awesome!",Rating
I was shocked to find the app includes overhead clearances and one can filter that down to what they are worried about.  Looks to be very thorough.  I have not yet tried it on the road but I am amazed at what I can find by sitting her in my house.  I am a little concerned about how much functionality I will find in remote locations with no cell service.  Time will tell.  I may have to update my rating when that situation arises which will be in 4 weeks.  Happy camping everyone!,Rating
"I love it, every one should have it",Rating
"When I was a second grader,I kept loosing on the game ""Bingo"".When I play it,I'm a winner.Thank yyy-yyy-??",Rating

Great idea and it works great too!,Rating

I live this app so much. It is really really funny. I used it on my whole family and they just started laughing. It is really fun to use when u r bored.,Rating
This is the best video editor ever!!! I also like extras for iMovie but the only thing was that I wished I could cut out things people said that I didn't want. Other than that I love it!!!,Rating
"Intuitive, limitless possibilities. Brings your artistic side out.",Rating
This app is very useful!!! It helped me with things,Rating
This app is absolutely the best!,Rating
The first app I ever bought...and still one of my favorites!,Rating
The title says it all...,Rating
"I love checking in to see the weather forecasts! And it's such a beautiful perspective of our planet!!! It takes me outside of my usual ""local"" mentality.",Rating
Its really fun and any age can play it and enjoy it! Will get you busy for a long time!,Rating
"I think it's a fun and AWSOME game for ""kids"" under 12 years old!!!!!",Rating
I added about 150 movies to the app very quickly! Every movie has been in the database.,Rating
Great app! Amazing features! Perfect for movie collectors. I love it!,Rating
And the fact people are freaking about how real it is is why i give it a 5. It bases its replies off human replies so its very realistic but varies so much.,Rating
Great app,Rating
Perfect!!!!,Rating
"The word and we listen to the word of the day and see if we know the meaning or something very close to it. We find it to be an entertaining 'game'.

THE BEST RATING
10 stars---no, 11 
Bbwwahahahahaha",Rating
I'm so impressed with this App! I tell everyone how it benefit & teaches everyday.,Rating
Great App to have around... No more need to carry a Dictionary or Thesaurus.,Rating
Reader works great though editing on some books is off enough to be  distracting.  Like the user interface and quick loading. Still struggling to figure out how to download (or find) other books as selection is rather limited.,Rating
I like the new features that make the product more Stanza-like. I still would like to be able to go directly from the library list to the current place in any given book without having to pass by the TOC page.,Rating
Love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order. Easy to use!,Rating
"I have already submitted a review when I first downloaded stating That this App is the best. Well, yesterday it proved itself. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. 

There is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.",Rating
This is easy to use and it helps keep up with meds and allergies for everyone in the household.  I love the med check feature.  It helps me to be a little more knowledgable about things to discuss with my doctor.  Great app!,Rating
"Dis game Is amazing its 3D affect just adds da thrill of u being in da game!!!!
(:",Rating
"Graphics are very nice. The game play is amazing, a lot of quick thinking. Plus you get to upgrade constantly. The one thing that bugs me is how short the game is and the way it repeats itself. That being said, I won't get tired of playing for a while.",Rating
Awesome graphics,Rating

I hate iTunes and was looking forward to 'clipping the cord'... What a disappointment that ios5 doesn't update my podcast feeds.  Thanks downcast for doing what iCloud was supposed to.  So worth the $2. Catch up Apple.,Rating
"If the stars could higher I would rate them as so. Want to be an orthopedic surgeon and this is the best app I've ever came across for learning the skeletal system!!! I would recommend it to anyone from a surgical trainee to a high school A&P student! The best, can't say it enough!",Rating
"Pretty clever app, works well!",Rating
A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate...also quite accurate!!!,Rating
This app is a great tool to have for just about all types of foodies.,Rating
Great app,Rating
"I use skritter for learning Japanese and it's an application that requires flash, however I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't keep up with the SRS if I was only able to access the program on my computer. Thanks to splashtop, now I can practice on the go. (that sounds like a infomercial lol)",Rating
Great,Rating
Must have,Rating
"I love this app on my phone and iPad, too. It's accurate and easy to add/delete cities. I love the graphics, too",Rating
Very nice !!!!!,Rating
Very helpful in planning my day. Gives hour by hour estimated weather that is just as accurate as any other weather report. Love the graphics behind all of the information. It mostly follows the weather that is expected for the hour which adds a lot of visual interest.,Rating
Great app and I live how it gives the sky look for the place I'm checking.,Rating
Weather app is awesome and very easy to use!,Rating

Love the learning tool this app provides.,Rating
Continues to amaze . . . with information  and views of stellar objects.,Rating

My 4 yr old can't get enough!,Rating
"This has everything I wanted Craigslist to have but which they NEVER THOUGHT OF!  I love to be able to see the large size pics, circle the ads I like, and cross off the ones I have no interest in.

Great content. New stuff all the time. Stuff for everyone. Never had a problem with App.,Rating
Great app!!,Rating
"Works great! Maps are good, better than my Garmin. Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service. Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps. Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS.",Rating
I love this app it is really handy when u r out in the woods,Rating
"The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like. It performs incredibly well, while offering most features (if not all) that users could want. Not only is it now offered at a lower price, but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade. Since few users need the enhancements, it is a great way to offer them.",Rating
I've been using Marine Traffic for years online and on my iPhone. Downloaded the iPad app and it's as simple (good thing) as always and the content is great. I only give it 4 stars because it needs Retina support which would make it excellent.,Rating
"Love the app, use it all the time to check shipping activity in Puget Sound. Helpful whether on land or on the water.",Rating
Great app.,Rating
Really like this app. It is a very easy way to journal,Rating
"I have Day One on both my iOS devices, and my Mac. It just works beautifully, seamlessly, and smoothly.

Add simple photo function, and you'll rule the journal app world. 

Five star!",Rating
"This is cool app I've used before.. but no search function.. ^^;; 

I need it much..",Rating
"This app is awesome and makes recording everything so easy, the only thing I can request is to make it compatible with iPads!",Rating
I have been a P90X client for some time now and love the workout!  With the P90X app I now have the option of taking my workout to the gym or with me when I travel. Plus the nutrition journal makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day. For me it is a great app! Glad I purchased this app!,Rating
I LOVE this game!!! Please add more options like a curler and much more stuff! I really want there to be a update!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and add MORE characters!!!,Rating
I love it- it's fun to play on boring car rides?,Rating
Great app for viewing weather.,Rating
It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100% wrong. So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input. I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining.,Rating
"Best CL app I've ever used, by far.",Rating
Easy to use,Rating
Great Craigslist app,Rating
Great little app to have on phone. Handy for those spur of the moment shopping sprees.  And easy to use to list items also.,Rating
App hasn't worked in a month. That shows no effort in trying to fix this. You all failed.,Rating
I just want my money back!!,Rating
Works yo.,Rating
Awesome ????????,Rating
Love it,Rating
"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",Rating
"I have used this on countless occasions now. It has come in handy, and when I do use it the other party is as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (may be iPhone speech recognitions problems) and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny. But, if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time. Overall very pleased with this for just a buck!",Rating
"I am truly amazed at how well this app works..the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation, IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME!! I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version..I am very very very pleased with this app..you should get it ??",Rating
"The adjustments in Snapseed are very good and it's simple to learn and use. However, I'm not a fan.  The tools are very specific purpose and I find myself constantly moving back and forth from one limited purpose tool to another. If you like a good sample of adjustments presented at one time, in one place and on screen at all times, Snapseed may not be what you're looking for.",Rating
"Best Post-Edit App that I've tried to date. Advanced features rival and even exceed that of Camera+ (which I also love). I did grab this free during a promo, but even at $4.99 this ones worth the splurge.",Rating
"Solid, but weird volume settings,",Rating
Even better than the real thing!,Rating
"I was looking for a good nightstand application and instead found a great app. Separate alarms, separate days, wake to music, slide dimmer. All around great app.",Rating

Love this app!!!  I use it often and it is dependable.,Rating
Gets better and better with every update. Thank you for this app. Much appreciated.,Rating
I wanted an App that would separate my videos from my photo library.  I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interruption from annoying videos.  The music stops and you have to start it over. Now the videos are on this app and I can play right through all my pictures.  Love it!,Rating
Very nice app,Rating
Gives hourly weather for the day too!,Rating
"Does everything I would need a simple weather app to do. Radar is slow to load, but I have another app for that. There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.",Rating
Really good !,Rating
Good App,Rating
"Best one so far, thanks",Rating
Great app! Couple suggestions for the next update though. Add a way to see the degree of angles and also it would be great to actually be able to have two videos side by side to compare.,Rating

It guesses is every time! Got all of one direction even Cher Lloyd! I love this app??????,Rating
Great app for news on demand. No wasted screens to navigate through. Would give it 5th star if there was a button to close the app. Love NPR!,Rating
Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!,Rating
"But make more apps! (People apple does not allow to open all apps directly, (only if the developer of app make it in code)) The launch of apps without safari is not possible! An some apps possible but still not faster.",Rating
Best shoe app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Correct dates and prices! Let's me know every thing about the shoe!??,Rating

"Excellent addition to the Angry Birds games. Great new features, challenges and visuals. If you are an Angry Birds fan, this is definitely worth it.

Its kewl,Rating
Love this app don't let me forget Birthdays.,Rating
"Ok people...this app works and if you are too stupid to figure out how to make something so simple work, you shouldn't own a smart phone, especially the iPhone. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the addition of all the contacts. Looking forward to future updates. ????????",Rating

Daddy like!,Rating
"I love this app. Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like, you can't see what the temp actually is. I would love to be able to see both at the same time.",Rating
"Fix it!  How many times do I have to send you the crash report before you fix the app? 

Until its fixed, I dislike this app",Rating
I've used this app for three seasons! This is the first year that NFL owns it. I've drafted 8 teams over those years with this app! Very user friendly.,Rating
Takes a minute to get use to it. But with a snake draft. It is the perfect app. Loved it and was happy with my picks. Didn't have to turn pages on a magazine to find my next pick.,Rating

Love this site it nails every question I have ever asked.very helpful and resourceful.once I found i could download this app for my phone it made it so much more convienant for us.my family goes by it and we love it!,Rating
"This app is so fantastic, I actually find it even better than the website. It is easy to navigate, easy to modify reservations. There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",Rating

Seems cool,Rating
AWSOME cool,Rating
Incredible !!!,Rating
this is a pretty good app. great to be free. it is super slow on load time. that needs to be fixed. also change the default time. it's so annoying because sometimes I forget to change it and dont see all my hw. also push notofications would be wonderful! other than that it's great. I'm a sophomore math major taking 20 hours and this app helped me stay on top of things!,Rating

I do wish i could search more recipes from the app. I've been having to go to the website to get more recipes, which isn't a problem, but it also isn't as convenient as accessing them from the app.",Rating

"First of all, both Dragon Dictation and Dragon Search are amazing and I'm using the slow 3G. They're beyond amazing on my wife's iPhone 4! As a heavy user of Dragon Dictation, it would be very useful to be able to clear the screen and start new, perhaps by shaking the iPhone. Sometimes it's easier to start over rather than edit out one word.",Rating

I really hope you guys upgrade and soon because it's making it pointless for me to be on the site...",Rating
"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",Rating
I find this app very useful. It has mechanism and class info that most of the other free programs are missing. You can't do much better (esp for free)!,Rating
Great,Rating

"Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the ""dial"" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",Rating
I absolutely love this app. I scan whatever I see....,Rating
"Awsome App , I Love Using This App :D",Rating

Great app,Rating
This app is so convenient! I looovvve it!!,Rating
Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.,Rating
Awesome! The real deal!,Rating
Somehow I lost my contacts. This app got everything back for me,Rating
Mediocre!! It's primitive!!!,Rating

I have made many purchases from FAB and have been mostly very satisfied. The offerings are unique and of good quality. But don't expect your stuff in a hurry as many items are handcrafted.

I have only started using this app after having it on my device for over 3 weeks. I was influenced to use it when a saw a colleague use hers with glee.

"This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics, cute characters, and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars.

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing. 

This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3. If that option becomes available, I would definitely buy this game.",Rating
Good job,Rating

I'm a long time premium user and am seriously considering other options",Rating
Hard to use takes up big chunks of the screen trying to sell me crap,Rating

That said, I've got iOS7 on my phone, but have not upgraded my iPad waiting for Apple to work some of the bugs out of the new OS for us tablet users As a result, synching between devices is not always reliable right now - just a watch-out",Rating
"Feels more fluid, controls are intuitive and exactly where I expect them to be Design meshes perfectly with iOS 7

Great job on this update )",Rating
"Evernote is no longer usable to me because I have not jumped on the iOS7 bandwagon I never adopt a new OS until the kinks have been wrung out Now I have lost the use of Evernote?and I used to use it a lot Bad call!

Now I add all my receipts and get rid of the paper This really has made tax preparation easier
My favorit app I don't know what I would do without it",Rating

Thanks,Rating
"Today's update, dated March 1, 2013 is horrible!  Every single time I open up the App, it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then, when I select either 'Title', which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes, in alphabetical order, or I select 'Created,', the App immediately crashes and closes  I have tried this over 50 times! I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail  I tried deleting the App all together, and then reloaded it, but still the same problem!  This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE!!!!!!!  I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created, and even each month is not in alphabetical order  THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE!!!!  I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents  If this bug isn't fixed pronto, I will have to delete Evernote permanently, and use a different App!  ARGHHHHHH!!!!!!",Rating
"I use Evernote every day for both work and personal note-taking glad the crash on launch was fixed so quickly! Would like to see complete parity (on formatting and some other features) between desktop and iPad versions, but it's getting really close",Rating

"Urrrrm	After my third re installing, it finally has scenery. Before hand, it was just black shapes everywhere. I could not even see the walls. This killed my internet as it is a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, their is no chance of a refund. Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to be seeing the right installment first time, a chance of a refund, and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I would love to have it on my tablet! Thank you ?",UserExperience
"Does exactly what it says on the tin	Effecient enough to check and respond to my emails",UserExperience
"Best of what's available	I've purchased a few of these word emulator apps and Office Suite is the best. It's very easy to edit with the toolbars. I would give it a five but there are some word spacing issues and I've lost edits occasionally when saving to Dropbox",UserExperience
"Finally an Office Suite which works great	I have gone through so many office suite and tried to find the suite which best support most common Microsoft Office suite applications. Finally this suite fills that suite to 80%. If the Font package was part of the suite then I would have given 95% and 5 star.",UserExperience
"Pretty good!	I've edited many photos using this application already. Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview. The beautify tool is a good example of this, as it may look fine in preview, but when you save it, you don't exactly get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated, but overall a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.",UserExperience
"Aside from the occasional glitch, pretty good	Awesome graphics, nice sound, just don't expect AC3 or 4 scale naval warfare. The battles are not what I'd call real time, more a cross between real and turn based. Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere. The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling. There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often.",UserExperience
"Great app	Found my Canon MX880 printer.   Worth the money as none of the other free applications worked to my liking.",UserExperience

Lots of fun to use... We live in a unpopulated area and it's neat to pick out which stars are what. The app works very well!,UserExperience
"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth. 

I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time. 

I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app.",UserExperience
"I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are. If you mountain bike, hike, camp, or travel this is a must need app! It now tracks altitude, pace, speed, and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure. By far this is the best app I have!",UserExperience
"This is, hands down, the most useful app. I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade. It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar. I love it!!",UserExperience

"This app is beast! The best thing is, is that it doesn't need Internet! Because I have an iPod touch so I don't have Internet on it in public. I recomend  this app!",UserExperience
This is a great little app especially for those with hectic schedules it keeps you in like for visual people like me.,UserExperience

It's a pure joy already having a pic when your friends call and sometimes contacts info from your FB friends that you haven't taken the time out to acquire. Fabulous!,UserExperience
At first I didn't have the challenges on and literally got board in about 10min. But when I turn the challenges on I was all over it like a hawk of a dead animal. So to get to the point BETER THAN MODERN COMBAT 3!!!!!!,UserExperience

Easy to use and very accurate. A must for any traveler!,UserExperience
I just finished up a weekend of playing and it was the first time I have used this product. I was more than impressed with it! The setlist option was my favorite part. We played several different times throughout the weekend and being able to program the songs into setlist form made it super easy to transition between songs. I highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it again!,UserExperience
Great for daily readings. I love it.,UserExperience
This is an excellent app to use in the daily devotional reading of the mass readings.  Well done!,UserExperience
What a bargain for all the benefits I receive daily from this app!!  The audio is especially good to have.  Reading (or listening) to the daily Mass readings has been a great help to me.  I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day.  I consider this to be a must-have app for all busy Catholics.,UserExperience
Fantastic app ! Makes reading forums so much easier that now I find myself doing it more. Great!!,UserExperience
"I think this app works better than using my desktop to use forums. Fast, eat to read, searches well. Wish it had Miniusa and Bike forums... Great for Tacoma World.",UserExperience

I love this app nothing better for the NASCAR fan!,UserExperience
"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",UserExperience
"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. 

Anyway, must have for all serious golfers.",UserExperience
Great app to keep track of hours. Especially if you're on salary or budgeting.,UserExperience
This a great tool for a rapid lab consultation.,UserExperience
"I am a very superstitious person. I love any kind of ghost story. Short, Long, or a book. But this app has everything from short stories to long. Definitely worth the $$",UserExperience
I'm ten and this stuff does not scare my and I'm  10 YEARS OLD!!!!,UserExperience
Recently used in several European cities and it was GREAT!,UserExperience
"The best news, I always check Drudge first for the rest of the story!",UserExperience
"It's just getting better and better. The signature capture is a huge time saver. Ever wonder how to put your contact info from their email into your Contacts, just copy their signature into this app, it will separate into different fields and put them in your iPhone Contacts. How great!",UserExperience
Someecards are super funny! They're a great way to give someone a good laugh. Sometimes I just like to look through them because they're fun to read.,UserExperience
Great App for Travelers. Highly recommend it!,UserExperience
"A well engineered multipurpose calculator.  If the extensive template library doesn't have what you need you can easily create your own calculators without a steep learning curve. As a repeat customer since the Palm handheld days, I definitely consider this a great value.  Keep up the good work!",UserExperience
This app has helped me control my phones battery usage.,UserExperience
This is so cool. I love how many different frequencies there are to listen to.,UserExperience
"This app works wonders. ""Scans"" come out very clear and easy to send items. One of my most used apps!",UserExperience
"I use this app for completing my required expense report. Stores pics so you can return to them, pics are super clear. I'd only wish for a two per page option as the scans come back a full page. Overall, only $2. Hell of an app.",UserExperience
Best replacement app if your laptop is broken!!,UserExperience
"This is a great educational app for students, especially the movies! It provides a great visual for abstract content.",UserExperience
Since signing up I've lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks it's great,UserExperience
Really like this app. It has been soo very helpful in tracking with everything instantly accessible. It really is amazing. Having previously worked in the weight loss industry for many years. I know that this is the key to planning and losing weight. I am doing well with both.,UserExperience
Simple to use. Works flawlessly.  Loads of books to choose from.  I'm a fan.,UserExperience
"I've bee using EveryTrail.com for years - loving its ease and look for uploading my rides and embedding the maps on my blog. I used the free app for a long time, until recently on a trip I needed to find a trail and download it to use offline. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS unit. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs. Worth every penny.",UserExperience
Helps so much with meal planning and grocery shopping.  Cuts time off of both those activities.,UserExperience
A must have if you like to cook.  I think it is great!  Have tried a baked chicken wing recipe and was almost like deep fried.  I'm from Buffalo NY so I know.  Like being able to save Recipes in recipe box on the app. Get this app.,UserExperience
Very useful. But it is difficult sometimes trying to type an essay without landscape mode. It is ridiculous how a word processing app doesnt let u type landscape.,UserExperience
Well worth it. Great tool for review and on the spur of the moment reference.,UserExperience
"I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is given in audio; I wish there was an option hearing all the muscles info in audio. For me, retaining info comes better in audio, activities, and constant quizzing.",UserExperience
I was very pleased with this app.  The graphics are excellent and the interface is very easy to use and navigate through.  The quiz options and video are a great bonus feature.  I am really satisfied (especially for the price) and look forward to trying out the other systems' software.  Nice Work!,UserExperience
"Excellent app, integrates well with Google Reader. A must-have app on all of my iDevices.",UserExperience
Love app easy to use,UserExperience
Very helpful in planning trip.,UserExperience
I love this app because it gives you lots of great ideas for your home.,UserExperience
A real lifesaver and eye opener for this iPad newbie.  I learned so much from this app.  Information is well written and easy to understand. Just wish my brain could retain it all for instant recall!,UserExperience
"Did not give 5 stars because have found not all campgrounds are listed.  Sure is helpful though 99.5% of time.  Have used for gas, reservations for camps, restaurant locations, low clearances.  Awesome!",UserExperience
I was shocked to find the app includes overhead clearances and one can filter that down to what they are worried about.  Looks to be very thorough.  I have not yet tried it on the road but I am amazed at what I can find by sitting her in my house.  I am a little concerned about how much functionality I will find in remote locations with no cell service.  Time will tell.  I may have to update my rating when that situation arises which will be in 4 weeks.  Happy camping everyone!,UserExperience
This application has been a lifesaver! It actually remotely sinks with both my IPhone and IPad . I love it!,UserExperience
I love it now i can make people look fat and it is so easy,UserExperience
"Intuitive, limitless possibilities. Brings your artistic side out.",UserExperience

Its really fun and any age can play it and enjoy it! Will get you busy for a long time!,UserExperience
Great app! Amazing features! Perfect for movie collectors. I love it!,UserExperience
And the fact people are freaking about how real it is is why i give it a 5. It bases its replies off human replies so its very realistic but varies so much.,UserExperience
I'm so impressed with this App! I tell everyone how it benefit & teaches everyday.,UserExperience
Love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order. Easy to use!,UserExperience
"I have already submitted a review when I first downloaded stating That this App is the best. Well, yesterday it proved itself. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. 

There is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.",UserExperience
"Graphics are very nice. The game play is amazing, a lot of quick thinking. Plus you get to upgrade constantly. The one thing that bugs me is how short the game is and the way it repeats itself. That being said, I won't get tired of playing for a while.",UserExperience
Awesome graphics,UserExperience
Told me I was 31 when in 13 very sad app lowers self asteem lol don't get this app it is misleading and very inaccurate do not waste ur time,UserExperience

I would recommend it to anyone from a surgical trainee to a high school A&P student! The best, can't say it enough!",UserExperience
A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate...also quite accurate!!!,UserExperience
"This is a short Halloween story. There are several puzzles and a simple story showing Mickey who is later joined by friends. My 2 1/2 year old will probably like it, but the 4 year old will be bored quickly. For one dollar this is ok.",UserExperience
This app is a great tool to have for just about all types of foodies.,UserExperience
"I use skritter for learning Japanese and it's an application that requires flash, however I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't keep up with the SRS if I was only able to access the program on my computer. Thanks to splashtop, now I can practice on the go. (that sounds like a infomercial lol)",UserExperience
Very nice !!!!!,UserExperience
Very helpful in planning my day. Gives hour by hour estimated weather that is just as accurate as any other weather report. Love the graphics behind all of the information. It mostly follows the weather that is expected for the hour which adds a lot of visual interest.,UserExperience

Great way to keep up on your crossfit progress.,UserExperience
Very nice radar app. Easy to use,UserExperience
"Lots of topics, something for everyone",UserExperience
"Works great! Maps are good, better than my Garmin. Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service. Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps. Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS.",UserExperience
"The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like. It performs incredibly well, while offering most features (if not all) that users could want. Not only is it now offered at a lower price, but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade. Since few users need the enhancements, it is a great way to offer them.",UserExperience
"Love the app, use it all the time to check shipping activity in Puget Sound. Helpful whether on land or on the water.",UserExperience
Really like this app. It is a very easy way to journal,UserExperience
"I have Day One on both my iOS devices, and my Mac. It just works beautifully, seamlessly, and smoothly.

Add simple photo function, and you'll rule the journal app world. 

Five star!",UserExperience
I have been a P90X client for some time now and love the workout!  With the P90X app I now have the option of taking my workout to the gym or with me when I travel.

I LOVE this game!!! Please add more options like a curler and much more stuff! I really want there to be a update!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and add MORE characters!!!,UserExperience
Great app for viewing weather.,UserExperience
It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100% wrong. So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input. I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining.,UserExperience
Great little app to have on phone. Handy for those spur of the moment shopping sprees.  And easy to use to list items also.,UserExperience
"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",UserExperience
"I have used this on countless occasions now. It has come in handy, and when I do use it the other party is as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (may be iPhone speech recognitions problems) and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny. But, if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time. Overall very pleased with this for just a buck!",UserExperience
"I am truly amazed at how well this app works..the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation, IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME!! I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version..I am very very very pleased with this app..you should get it ??",UserExperience

Gives hourly weather for the day too!,UserExperience
"A must-have for students, or anyone who wants to improve their word power!",UserExperience
It guesses is every time! Got all of one direction even Cher Lloyd! I love this app??????,UserExperience
Great app for news on demand. No wasted screens to navigate through. Would give it 5th star if there was a button to close the app. Love NPR!,UserExperience
Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!,UserExperience
Best shoe app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Correct dates and prices! Let's me know every thing about the shoe!??,UserExperience
"Excellent addition to the Angry Birds games. Great new features, challenges and visuals. If you are an Angry Birds fan, this is definitely worth it.

Love it. Keeps me occupied while i have d time to wait,UserExperience

"Many options, easy to use, show it off on instagram and Facebook!",UserExperience
"I love this app. Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like, you can't see what the temp actually is. I would love to be able to see both at the same time.",UserExperience
I've used this app for three seasons! This is the first year that NFL owns it. I've drafted 8 teams over those years with this app! Very user friendly.,UserExperience
We always use this app as we are always looking for great places to eat. We don't cook a lot so we look for variety in the places we try. This app never disappoints!,UserExperience

"This app is so fantastic, I actually find it even better than the website. It is easy to navigate, easy to modify reservations. There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",UserExperience

Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone.

That moment I figured out I could transfer photos from my iPhone to laptop faster via dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port,UserExperience
"Flawless operation - ZERO problems Easy to use - almost effortless New auto-upload of photos and videos is a great &amp useful addition Customer support is second to none (when I did have a question, support answered it before two hours had passed)",UserExperience
I love the idea of Dropbox but my cloud does the same thing My videos take a really long time to upload I think it froze ( If the app didn't take up space on my iPad then I would be impressed ),UserExperience
"Convenient! No more lugging the laptop or losing a thumb drive My files are accessible anytime, anyone, from any of my devices or another's With three full time students in the house the affordable upgrade holds docs, data, music and more! Lots of room available More convenient and more affordable than an external drive",UserExperience
Nice UI Keep up the good work!,UserExperience
I love the new design for iOS 7,UserExperience
New interface is great,UserExperience
It's a great app especially for iphone users since they can't add storage to their phones but any time u send a email to a friend inviting them to get it they give you more memory,UserExperience
"Nice design refresh Looks great 

I love this app Dropbox totally saved me at work I had to email a bunch of large files and the work email system wouldn't take it 

Dropbox worked flawlessly Not only did they get links to download the files, but they could also view content right in their web browser PDFs, Word docs, and videos all were viewable in the browser for them It made presentations a breeze! 

I now use Dropbox for personal use too Love it",UserExperience
"Works well, especially for saving files for offline use",UserExperience
Simple to use And the voice recognition is great!,UserExperience
"My wife and I share a 100GB account, and it's amazing! So many things

Automatic photovideo upload, iPhoto import, works with the Mailbox app, shared folders, photo aggregation on the website and mobile, the ability to store files only on the cloud (saves space on my Mac from old files)

and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere

I could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files?

One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll (say, for #TBT), don't automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It's already in Dropbox, silly And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload",UserExperience
"I've always found Dropbox a bit buggy, but it's gotten worse since I updated to IOS 7  When I download zip files or webpages &amp open the files, the screen is blank, blackened or a blurred enlarged image of the symbol (of Facebook, Google or other symbols related to the site that the the zip file or webpages it came from 

As a teacher, I rely on having access online &amp off line related to research  for work my work as a teacher  Also, I am required to write notes &amp save them as zip files in order to save space

So, please fix Dropbox! Why does it keep telling me that I can't open some documents &amp that I don't have the authorization to alter or edit my document on the flip side, some documents tell me to enter a password (???)

If anyone has any suggestions to improve this or recommends a different program to recommend, I would appreciate it

Thanks!",UserExperience
This is a must have App as you can set it to sync all your pictures and once you take one they are saved in the cloud and also accessible by any other device you have Dropbox installed on and are signed into! One amazing MUST HAVE product and App xx,UserExperience
"I use Dropbox for everything Having this available easily on my phone made checking updates on projects from work to sharing items much easier when I'm not at a computer Also makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer since I never seem to move them 

Shameless plus here - works great combined with Ifttt to move post record things on calendar emails contacts via spreadsheet or special folders",UserExperience
Not sure how I lived without it Best way I know to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from anywhere on any device!,UserExperience
Dropbox is amazing and perfect for storage and safety I love it! I just wish there was an option to change the name of pictures and documents through your phone,UserExperience
"I use it to sync files between a desktop, laptop, iPad, iPod and iPhone 

And for collaborating with others by using shared files and folders 

I once had a problem on my iPad with an endless loop asking me to connect to iTunes But that turned out to be an Apple problem which for me could only be solved by a complete erase and restore 

Since the problem only occurred in DropBox, I initially assumed it was their problem It was not",UserExperience
"I've tried Google Drive, Box, Skydrive, but none of them could upload a 20 minute video I took Dropbox was the only one that accepted my file",UserExperience
I can pretty much have access to all my photos and videos on the go without it taking space on my phone Love ittt &lt3,UserExperience
Dropbox works great I can access files anywhere Highly recommend,UserExperience
"Simple, just what I needed to make transferring certain photos from phone to computer and vice versa simple Thanks!",UserExperience
"Very slow uploading, and poor background uploading ( does it really need 3h to upload several megabyte video over 10 Mbit internet ?",UserExperience
"This app has been go so far for me On my iPod touch 4 generation I has done so much in so little of time Little than 30 seconds it had my account created and pictures uploading on there! Although I am looking in to this, I trust this will keep mine and your apple devices' apps, music, photos videos and so on safe with all your personal files )",UserExperience
"It's super easy to copy pictures to clipboard or even save them to your phone, but why can't I download my videos?",UserExperience
"This app is really useful for having access to documents while I'm out  The one big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app  I'd love to be able to share a folder via the app and I've needed to so this before while I was out, but unfortunately, this app as of 3113 doesn't have that feature  It would be really useful to have!",UserExperience
Very convenient for moving files without connecting to a computer!,UserExperience
"You should put the folders first And then the files!
I would put a folder as favorite, thus putting all the files inside this as favorite too",UserExperience
"I rely on Dropbox for syncing daily annotated PDFs from my iPad to my home computer
After today's update sync stopped working",UserExperience
"It's a really good cloud app, but what makes it stand out is the new pdf viewer! Now I can read huge files on the iPad You can't do that on Google Drive's app",UserExperience
"This was a long wait, very glad to have this feature!",UserExperience
"I use several apps for PDF viewing and one feature that keeps me on the prowl for the holy grail of PDF viewers, is an app that supports PDF markup Being a musician and heavy e-reader, I rely heavily on PDF markup 

Dropbox, give us some simple PDF markup abilities, eg, highlight, pen, erase, opacity, and you will put several PDF viewer apps to bed Couple these features with the ability to share a folder of PDFs with other Dropbox users and you've converted me, and countless others, to PDF viewing through Dropbox",UserExperience
The new PDF reader is AWESOME!!,UserExperience
"It takes forever to upload photos, 2-3 weeks after I started the photos finally became viewable I had no problems installing the last update I love the recent upgrades Syncs perfectly Sharing is easy Overall, a great app but needs a few tweaks",UserExperience
This works wonderful on my iPhone 4S I have many things on my PC and it automatically syncs to my iPhone I am never without important documents that I need to review or look up that are password encoded Super easy and a huge time saver Love it!!,UserExperience
"I gotta say, overall I like this app, although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth The reason is because I start downloading the whole file, then start streaming it Once the 15 min is up, I then switch to the downloaded file To me, this uses more data Why can't I just stream the whole thing? Overall, though, I like everything else about this app",UserExperience
Nice and smooth photo streaming from device to device,UserExperience
"Honestly, it took me some time to get used to using this application - web clipping, photo notes, sharing, etc, but now I find this app to be the 'deal killer' - the one thing that MUST be on every device - 

The note scanning is so powerful it can read my scribbles (take notes in a meeting, take pics in evernote, throw them out!) 

We are now exploring the business application - sky's the limit",UserExperience
Best app ever made for busy people Keeps up with everything and great app for people with jobs and hobbies that take up your time,UserExperience
"It's wonerful I keep recipes, receipts, , knitting patterns, copies of postcards and greeting cards from friends, car maintenance records, appliance manuals, parts numbers for appliance parts, and many other things I keep schedules for my favorite sports teams, information about attractions I would like to visit the next time I travel to various cities, I keep business cards and journal articles that I use at work Easy to search for information when I need it",UserExperience
Good app for noting but too expensive to use it for poor students  60mb is not enoughcould you make it more plz ?,UserExperience
"Green interface doesn't look, or feel good Nor is it more useful Maximizing space to type in should be the goal, however, it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and advertising too much It probably isn't even an issue they may have rolled out the advertisements at the wrong time",UserExperience
"I started to use evernote since high school, but didn't feel that useful Now i am a college student, I use evernote in every life I love the highlight section, but wish there is more color than yellow Moreover, I enjoy the website version as well It is organized and sophistic Thank you for providing this application It is so convenience",UserExperience
I love the app for allowing me to keep my notes organized and synchrd across devices I also love the feature of sharing stuff with mates The only thing I long for is collaboration on notes,UserExperience
Brilliant app but crashes on iPad and iPhone,UserExperience
Once I learned to use the notebookmultiple tag search I was very pleased with the new update  I use Evernote for my GTD system and primarily work on iPad  The new graphics are great  Thanks for my most used app,UserExperience
"The most amazing app, for sure the most used on my iPad, however I liked some features of the older version, please bring back the option to make Paragraph headers and subsections The typing could be faster but Still great app",UserExperience
"I like the UI improvements with the new version The old UI was hideous and I usually used En via another app like drafts or IFTTT 

But the fact that I cannot add recent photos from my album!?!?!!? This is the main function for me of Evernote This must be fixed!",UserExperience
I like the concept and automation using the subject line,UserExperience
"I use EN constantly through the day for various productivity tasks It performs well and all my devices are always in sync, so my files and notes are always handy No crashes or complaints with the new design It just works and I love it",UserExperience
"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber

The mobile app, however, seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements,' which are essentially ads, now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra-premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work, I'd subscribe!

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

???
ORIGINAL REVIEW
Thanks for your hard work Happy to be a premium subscriber

Only suggestion add ability to copy note links",UserExperience
"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great 

But the design of this app is terrible  It's jumbled, confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality 

Please redesign the app  Again",UserExperience
"This version still has a marketplace  full of ads I can't hide, and the image attachment only shows me pics from September and earlier So it's pretty useless

Quit trying to sell me stuff and fix your bugs!!!!!",UserExperience
"I am so disappointed to see the turn that the ios app has taken There's so much to dislike about this craptastic abomination that I'm not even going to try 
I'm a long time premium user and am seriously considering other options",UserExperience
"The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say, I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there, you just have to (gasp) look for a sec 

If you are having issues, contact support before blasting the app And take a deep breath folks Life isn't that bad",UserExperience
It's a app that you can do pretty much everything from making to do list to office papers It's great for people that are on the go and can store almost anything and have it in the palm of their hand,UserExperience
"The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version, but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion, I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes, I will give it 5 stars",UserExperience
"I love, love, love Evernote! It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible!

The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless

I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence 

Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again, working like the desktop version would be better here

Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag

The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is the buggiest iOS I can remember

I'm not mad Just frustrated 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version, not the Evernote across platforms",UserExperience
"The search function isn't working and I have to sign in every time I open it Evernote needs to fix this Other than that, I love Evernote",UserExperience
"My Mac OS X version is working fine, but the app does not upload my data until I soft reset the phone Useless iOS 7, iPhone 5",UserExperience
"I've used other note taking apps before, but this is my favorite I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of all its capabilities, but I love the fact that it will sync across all my devices  My notes are easy to find It would've great if there was a way to hide some of my notebooks with a password for secure data That's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five",UserExperience
Great app that I have used regularly but seems a bit jerky since the iOS 7 update and update of app itself  A bit off putting when trying to type!,UserExperience
"I use evernote for most of my note taking, but now I have to pay 5 dollars a month just for a slightly longer note? Ridiculous!",UserExperience
"I am using this to reduce paper clutter in my house So far, so good Notes from the kids' school and organizations get photographed and organized in one notebook Notes for parties in another Ideas for the house are organized too, including pictures from home and garden magazines Love it so far I am a little worried, however, that I need access to the Internet for it Not sure if this will work then",UserExperience
I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also did away with everything you ever had saved  They did however manage to maintain the notebook namesunfortunately all of the notes within those notebooks were erased  I used this app for work and personal businessall files gone!  Be sure to only use this app for unimportant notes  Very disappointed -(,UserExperience
"I have over 200 notes in Evernote (verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom), but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted and reinstalled it Logging out and logging back in didn't work The new UI will take some getting used to but feels cleaner and faster than before",UserExperience
"I have to say that Evernote is in the top 3 ranking of my productivity apps, if not number 1 So simple to use I use it to store all sorts of data that I need to be able to recall quickly 
Great for note taking, recipes, software keys, wifi settings Endless uses",UserExperience
"I can't believe you guys removed one of the most useful features of Evernote, which was the ability to style lines as either a section, subsection, paragraph or blockquote That was the only way we could give some hierarchy to our notes

Now all my notes are one dimensional and its impossible to organize my thoughts How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary? Do you guys not use your own app? How am I supposed to outline my notes? This is really a big let down to an otherwise great update But it's too big an omission for me too be happy about anything else That's why I give it 2 stars",UserExperience
"Easy camera function allows for adding recipes right to notebook Separate notebooks make keeping all pieces of a project together regardless of media Used it for remodeling projects, and it's where I keep my collection of recipes, regardless of initial source Have used it for about a year and unlike other apps, I'm still using it",UserExperience
"PC, laptops , droid, tablet, two iPhones and one set of reference documents on all of them for myself and the wife What the heck was I doing sending copies and updates in msgs and hand written notes, I'm so embarrassed I did not find this 3 years ago?",UserExperience
It's like carrying 40 different notebooks around in your pocket all the time And the fact that all the info and ideas you collect during the day is waiting for you on your desktop computer when you get home is invaluable,UserExperience
Absolutely love this app Found out about it from a fellow Southwestair flyer Use it all the time for 'must saves' from twitter &amp the internet Easy to use with folders &amp tags Can keep all of my daily notes &amp thoughts close at hand,UserExperience
"The more I use Evernote, the more ways I find to use it Love the excellent and consistent multi-platform experience and sync",UserExperience
"I love Evernote and I use it everywhere and on various devices (iOS and desktop) I used to love the simplicity of the web interface, but the new one seems too cumbersome and I've had some really weird issues where it has overwritten my notes Overall, I would rate the environment 45",UserExperience
Syncs great with desktop Allowing me to keep my thoughts organized and accessible,UserExperience
Keeps track of any and everything and just keeps getting better Whether it is a document or a picture it can be captured ether by email or snapping a photo and you then have it forever Retrieving it is simple by tags or searching It just makes life simpler,UserExperience
"After I downloaded this it just sat on my desktop for a million years Then I got the bright idea of taking a screen snapshot of an Expedia itinerary Wow! Suddenly I am off and running, saving and accessing info on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings I would like it better if there were multi- layer nesting available for the notebooks, but it is pretty cool 
Btw, I use the skitch add-on for editing,reformatting, *bold* print, etc  It's great",UserExperience
"Evernote is now virtually unusable I was simply trying to toggle check marks in my grocery list yesterday, and it would take three or more attempts to acknowledge me, and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up without any reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list When the program did finally acknowledge me, the check marks would be delayed by about 2 seconds each as if it had to stop and sync between every gesture

Do people even test apps before release any more? Who thought 'Oh, yeah, this looks perfect,' should be fired",UserExperience
Probably the beat all around note taking app good for pretty much everything,UserExperience
A wonderful substitute for loss of brain function in middle age It remembers everything for me across platforms!,UserExperience

"I use Evernote for work and personal use  I was an early adopter and have found it to be an incredibly useful tool for productivity, personal reference, and as an idea-base It is extremely reliable, intuitive, and something I use many times a day 

I love it and highly recommend it to others",UserExperience
"As a new Mom, blogger  writer, grad student and full time professional, I manage lots of details, and this app helps to keep it all straight! I love it! Thank you!!",UserExperience
"Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note one can take It's great to have the ability to input URL, photos, audio, and text And great that it has desktop integration for a computer

The drawback that I've encountered is though it offers labels it doesn't offer folders Editing and the dashboard in the app could use an easier interface Still good app though",UserExperience
Evernote is my daily Goto app for all of my actions and to dos The file folder UI can be clunky but under the covers this app delivers,UserExperience
"I've been using this for just over 6 weeks and have eliminated all paper notes Even when I find myself at a meeting without a laptop or iPad, my paper notes easily get loaded in simply by snapping a photo 

Additionally, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to organize among a couple different dimensions for easy retrieval at a later date",UserExperience

Use Evernote all the time to keep track of my lifeawesome,UserExperience
"As a writerdaydreamer, I'm constantly in my head thinking up new ideas, and having a tool that allows me to access my material pretty much anywhere is fantastic Instead of just jotting down a note (which I can't always do) and referring to it later on once I've gotten home, logged onto a computer, &amp opened up a Word document, it's so much easier and convenient to do it on this app I've even used Evernote for school stuff, essays mostly, so there's no need for emailing documents to myself There are only a few errorsglitches that I've encountered but nothing that makes me want to stop using this app I love it too much!!",UserExperience
Syncs well and wonderful for projects at work and home,UserExperience
I love the fact that Evernote allows me to sync my notes between each of my devices and computers I use it everyday to keep everything right in front of me I wish the interface a bit different Maybe the option of colored notes?,UserExperience
"Editing ability and consistency on iPhone has improved with recent updates Still some work to do to allow additional font sizes and such for items created on iPhone Should get a 45 for that reason but it would be unfair to rate this a 4 bc of those minor limitations Robust editing on Mac, online allow workarounds",UserExperience
"Ok what don't I use Evernote for? Nothing! I use for everything! Storing contacts, business cards, my son's artwork, recipes, food journals, workout logs, useful documents, receipts, magazine clippings

I get cross-eyed hunting through a long list of same 
colored notebooks The ability to sort and organize by color would be wonderful I'd know exactly what section to go to rather quickly

I'm now regaining some confidence that what I'm doing is right!",UserExperience

"Waited for this update, then we get this? EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It is now obvious to me, and I have been in denial for over a year 

There is no font control, editing is random and buggy, slow as molasses, and unreliable-- when you take time to write a paragraph, you want 100% confidence EverNote will not crash midway, or you get Synchronization Fail and thus lose your work 

Note sorting and text-friendly organization (ie, lists) have been thrown out the window for a shiny interface and lots of icons and flashy graphics I can't write with the confidence that EverNote will not crash, but HEY, I can take a picture of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I quit I am canceling my membership today 

When you get serious about EverNote as a tool for work, send me an email Actually, don't bother",UserExperience
"I love, love this app! Evernote is so easy to use and very functional when surfing the web It's like having a mini-assistant helping take notes!!",UserExperience
"$50 bucks a year to use this? iCloud is FREE Why do we have to pay so much money to get access?

 5 star review is well deserved!",UserExperience
This new layout is awesome Use this app daily and love it,UserExperience
"I am extremely excited about the possibilities for tracking my prospects and clients in a user friendly manner with evernotes  The Tag and Search functions make it easy to recall prospects who are interested in specific models --- new and used  I can order the searches to look at latest entries first which is very important in my business  Many other applications work well, but I do have one observation that you should be aware of  There seems to be a bug in the search function for notebooks, when you do a search in a specific notebook  The all notebooks search works fine, as does the tag search breakdown  All in all, this is a great program",UserExperience
"We arrived at dollar with a 2 pm reservation plus the rapid service I signed up for last week It's now been over an hour in line The placed is mobed with hundreds of customers in line yet very very few counters open It's about 40% running There is no where to sit and crying babies and disappointed families in every corner Food is on the floor and the place is complete disarray I will never rent of the dump again I would rather walk Actually if I had walked to Pasadena I would be almost there Plus the staff are rude and ignorant No compassion for the customers standing in this never ending line rather than be with their families for Xmas My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mom She has a whole dinner planned tonight Unfortunately we will be here at dollar waiting for our pre reserved rental car Rush hour starts in 30 minutes, that will end any chance of seeing my family tonight Shame on dollar for not properly staffing their rental car center during the important holiday season",UserExperience

Reviews are great but Tilripadvisor reads them first They review photos too I have a negative review and they wouldn't post the photos Something about the photos not being clear! Bullsh$t!  They were mint and I even had my BF take photos and give them to me  Ridiculous!  Speaking the truth is a problem for them I had undercooked chicken and they didn't want to post that I could've been sick If they prefer to alter reviews then why bother!!,UserExperience

Great app to write my reviews on! Very user friendly and easy to navigate,UserExperience
"I always read all the reviews while we are traveling on the road My husband and I crisscross the country every summer and I am the navigator I find most reviewers to be honest if you read all of them or at least half, you can get a pretty good opinion Many times I didn't pay attention to a negative review because I thought they had some sort of personal problem and was sorry afterwards Trip advisor is a good opinion to take into account when you are traveling in a new place and have no idea where to go",UserExperience
"The new (complete rewrite) version is a disappointment  Very slow to no response to photo paging requests, lack of hotel search facility for a given city and incomplete searches for hotels  These are just a few problems I noted on first use of rewritten app  Needs some work  Hopefully there will be an update released soon  This used to be a great app",UserExperience
"I find it an useful tool  It is helpful to read multiple opinions, one can generally wade through the static and determine what fits  It has a vast amount of data, but be careful and glean from other sources to get information Remember it is a tool to help plan and execute your own trip, use many data points and don't look for perfect wisdom  Some people's jewels are NOT others treasures   Of I had to put a &lt  &gt value, I would say about 70% accurate, including my own ratings, I am very picky, some people just want to be out of the rain",UserExperience
"Love trip advisor I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never gone wrong I have tried other food apps and they are not even close to being as accurate A plus is the fact they don't mess with rating fast food restaurants Who needs a star rating for a McDonalds, Burger King, etc?  Also very good for finding a good hotel",UserExperience

One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you, or when you use a filter, not everything shows up  An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel  It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search  But, when I searched by name, there was the pub and reviews",UserExperience

"The TripAdvisor App is a shorter and better way to look up something instead of going onto their website and wasting more time!

Great job!!!",UserExperience

"I've been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues When left running in the background on some modes, I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual I'm not sure if it is that, or in just using it more than normal It'd be great if there was a way to see my 'saves' sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen Finally, when I'm using this while traveling, I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again, so a star off for that",UserExperience
"I've been contributing to TripAdvisor for many years now  It is the first place I check when heading to a new area for information on hotels, restaurants and activities  The app on my iPad makes it easy for on-the-go reviews  It is easy to use and quite intuitive in how it works  No complaints",UserExperience
